# Progress

## Current Status

The Challenge 2 Obsidian knowledge-base prototype is implemented and merged into the fork's `main` branch via fork-local PR #1.

The current local working branch also contains a small fix for Obsidian Mermaid rendering in `challenge-2/wiki/architecture.md` and `challenge-2/tools/build_wiki.py`. The fix changes Mermaid node labels from ordered-list style labels (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) to `Step 1:`, `Step 2:`, etc.

## Completed

- Built a repeatable Challenge 2 wiki generator.
- Generated source notes for all 43 Challenge 2 documents.
- Generated topic pages, entity pages, maps of content, architecture notes, source-register JSON, workbook exports, and lint reports.
- Preserved raw Challenge 2 sources as immutable source material.
- Added synthetic fixture metadata for staff-directory content without redacting the synthetic data.
- Fixed generated link integrity issues and removed local filesystem path leakage from generated metadata.
- Merged the fork-local Challenge 2 PR into the fork's `main` branch.
- Resolved all fork-local PR review threads.
- Fixed the architecture Mermaid diagram labels that Obsidian rendered as unsupported Markdown lists.
- Added repo-wide tracking files and a documentation lockstep check for local and pull-request validation.

## Validation

- Challenge 2 strict build previously passed with `43 sources, 81 notes, 0 lint issues`.
- Current lightweight validation for the Mermaid fix passed:
  - `uv run --with openpyxl python -m py_compile challenge-2/tools/build_wiki.py`
  - Checked that the architecture Mermaid labels no longer start with ordered-list syntax.
- Documentation lockstep validation passed locally:
  - `python3 tools/check_documentation_lockstep.py`
  - `python3 -m py_compile tools/check_documentation_lockstep.py`
  - `git diff --check`

## Open Items

- Add a visible search or query UI over the generated knowledge base.
- Add `challenge-2/wiki/demo-answers.md` with source-backed answers to the official demo questions.
- Add a concise judging evidence page covering user need, prototype scope, AI-tool usage, validation, limitations, and next steps.
- Decide whether to commit or discard local Obsidian workspace state changes in `challenge-2/.obsidian/workspace.json`.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Commit the Mermaid rendering fix, documentation tracking files, and documentation lockstep enforcement.
2. Add source-backed demo answers for the five Challenge 2 demo questions.
3. Add a small search interface or script that queries `wiki/data/source-register.json` and source-note text.
4. Add tests around link rewriting, metadata extraction, source coverage, and lockstep documentation expectations.
